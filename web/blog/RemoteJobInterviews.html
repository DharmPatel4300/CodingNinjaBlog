          Are you the one who is looking for remote job opportunities? And have
          you gone through such an interview process?

          If you are hunting for jobs, you must be familiar with the process;
          you get a call from the HR of the so and so company; they tell you,
          “hey, we like your profile and want to organise an interview,” and
          then they drop an online interview link.

      <h2>Tips and preparation steps to ace your remote interview</h2>
      <article>

          <li>
            <h3>Organize your space</h3>
            <p>
              Is your home office a mess? Look around; if it is, the hiring
              manager may fear you won’t be effective in a remote role.
            </p>
            <p>Why?</p>
            <p>
              Your home office needs to be clutter-free and noise-free. It
              should be an ideal working space, like one in the office. So, if
              you have children or pets, make sure they are occupied during your
              interview process.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last thing you want is any distractions in job interviews,
              especially when it is remote because HR will be looking at the
              actual environment you’ll be working.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Test your online interview setup</h3>
            <p>
              You don’t want any last-moment glitches, so test the specific
              platform that you are going to use for the interview.
            </p>
            <p><img
                src="../../images/blog-banner-1.png"
                alt="blog-banner-1"
                width="100%"
              /></p>
            <div>
              <ul type="circle">
                <li>Do a test run on the specific platform.</li>
                <li>Ensure there are no unexpected errors, and</li>
                <li>Familiarize yourself with the platform.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              Ask your lazy friends to help and do a dry run with them. Ask them
              whether they can see and hear you clearly. If not, run an internet
              speed test and pay close attention to the upload speed so the
              interviewer can see and hear you clearly.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Be ready to share why you’re interested in working remotely</h3>
            <p>
              If you are applying for a remote job opportunity, the employer
              will assume that you know this and find it tempting. You are not
              the only one applying for this. The number of applications for
              remote jobs has increased over the last 2 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because people want freedom and flexibility, you should expect one
              or two interview questions about what you think of working
              remotely.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, what should be the reply to these questions? No one can tell
              you a better answer than you because you know your life. We can
              give you some ideas, and if it is applicable to you, then you can
              use them.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s okay to mention work-life balance, the fact that you’re more
              productive at home, or whatever else motivates you to work
              remotely. Just be honest.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Review your recent accomplishments and successes</h3>
            <p>
              You should be familiar with your recent work accomplishments
              because the employer will ask you about them.
            </p>
            <p>
              You should be confident about your work and don’t hesitate too
              much to answer these set of questions –
            </p>
            <div>
              <ul type="circle">
                <li>
                  What were you responsible for in your most recent position?
                </li>
                <li>Mention challenges have you overcome recently?</li>
                <li>What is your greatest achievement in your life/career?</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              You can answer these questions confidently if you review your
              resume and make sure you are familiar with the work.
            </p>
            <p>
              It may sound obvious, but if it’s been a while since you wrote
              your resume, you may have forgotten some details.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Write down 3-4 questions for the interviewer</h3>
            <p>
              At the end of the interview, the interviewer will ask you, “Do you
              have any questions for me?” and you do not want to be the person
              who says, “No.”
            </p>
            <p>
              If you don’t ask any questions, then the interviewer is simply
              going to think that you are not that interested in this profile.
              You’ll win more jobs if you ask some great questions to the
              interviewer.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can learn so much from the job interview by asking questions.
              Here are some questions you can ask-
            </p>
            <div>
              <ul type="circle">
                <li>How is your performance going to be measured?</li>
                <li>
                  What are the company’s training and remote onboarding process?
                </li>
                <li>Team and company goals for the upcoming year.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              You reached the end; we assume you read the above thoroughly. If
              you’ve then; you are ready to ace your interview. And if you need
              help, you can reach out to your BFF
